# Programming
SunnyLand is a 2D platformer made with the Unity game engine. It is coded with the C# programming language. The goal is to go through different levels while avoiding enemies and collecting gems.





# Artwork
The artwork is not owned by me. It was created by Ansimuz, and I got all the games art by him on the unity asset store.
