# SunnyLand 1.0

Developed by Alexander Philippopoulos

# Description
SunnyLand is a 2D platformer made with the Unity game engine. The goal of the game is to go through different levels while avoiding enemies and collecting gems. As of now, there are only two levels, but I do plan on making more in the future. Any feedback is appreciated. Have fun playing.

# Programming
All the games programming and design was done by me. I used the C# programming language to create the dynamic aspects of the game. I also designed the games UI and menus.


# Artwork and Music
The artwork and music is not owned by me. The respectable owner of the games art and music is Ansimuz. I got all his art and music from his free asset pack.


# Sound Effects
I exported the games sound effects from Pixabay.
