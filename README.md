# SunnyLand

Developed by Alexander Philippopoulos

# Description
SunnyLand is a 2D platformer made with the Unity game engine. It is coded with the C# programming language. The goal is to go through different levels while avoiding enemies and collecting gems.

# Programming
All the games programming and design was done by me. I used the C# programming language to create the dynamic aspects of the game. I also designed the games UI and menus.


# Artwork and Music
The artwork and music is not owned by me. The respectable owner of the games art and music is Ansimuz. I got all his art and music from his free asset pack.


# Sound Effects
I exported the games sound effects from Pixabay.
